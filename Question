Dear Jadi
Thanks for your great GIT tutorial at first
I'm a hardware and software developer
so in my projects I need to have several seperated git folder (repository)
at last I have to merge them into one project but each repository must be 
in a subfolder and push them as final project to git storage

or let me explain in in other way
ex:
we have several person in a project who working on each section of the project.
for example Ali work on Graphic , hassan work on UI/UX , Abas work on APIs
firstly all of them start individualy and start a new git repository for themselve
after a while I have to merge whole the project into another repository to push to 
git storage (I did it with fetch but...) but I want to have seperate folder for each 
person in final repository!

----ALI------\
              |
---HASSAN---- + -----> New-Repository(that have folder named Ali,Hassan,Abas)
              |
---ABAS------/


Please Help Me!
sorry for this long story
